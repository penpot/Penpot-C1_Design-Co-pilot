# Approach #3 | New layout generation
    
The system will take user input about the desired layout and generate a new page based on the existing elements. The idea is to utilize a top-down approach, first generating a layout, after - populating it with elements. 

| Technology readiness | Risks | Complexity |
| ----- | ----- | ---------- |
| <div style="width: 200"> ðŸŸ¡ Some elements are available, but further development and research needed | <div style="width: 150pt"> ðŸŸ¡ Moderate risk | <div style="width: 130pt"> ðŸ”´ Complex |

## Technology

Pre-process SVG layouts â†’  Clean by place holding elements 
â†’ Input to LLM Model 
â†’ Model output high-level layout based on the prompt 
â†’ Post-process by replacing placeholders with SVG 
â†’ Output the final layout.

## Pros and Cons

ðŸŸ¢Â Pros

- The ability to generate new layouts based on user inputs and existing elements allows for highly adaptive and custom designs
- The model generates a high-level layout based on the prompt, which would save computation cost and time for outputting full-length SVG with content.

ðŸ”´Â Cons

- No respective open-source Github repo is available for checking the performance of the research paper
- Generation quality has the risk of not meeting the designer's requirements since there is limited research on SVG generation
