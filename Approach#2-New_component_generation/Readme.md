# Approach #2 | New component generation
    
The system will take user input about the desired component and generate a new component based on the text prompt, which will then be interpreted by a chatGPT-like system and applied to the SVG element.

## Technologies

- Following IconShop [[Paper](references/Research%20papers/IconShop.pdf)]. Based on a transformer-based method to achieve text-to-SVG. The dataset usage is more simple than VectorFusion.
- Following VectorFusion [[Paper](references/Research%20papers/VectorFusion.pdf)]. Prompting stable diffusion -> raster image -> pre-processing (i.e., background removal) -> vectorisation into vector image via Vectorisation [[Tutorial](https://blog.thea.codes/raster-vectorization-with-python/)][[Sample code](https://gist.github.com/theacodes/2e13e4e05700279734ca4b34df370adb)]
or Vtracer [[Github](https://github.com/visioncortex/vtracer)]

## Requirements

- ML model: [IconShop](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.14400.pdf) or [VectorFusion](https://ajayj.com/vectorfusion)

## Relevant works

[Research] 

- VectorFusion [[Paper](references/Research%20papers/VectorFusion.pdf)]: text-to-image-to-vector method
- IconShop [[Paper](references/Research%20papers/IconShop.pdf)]: The key to the success of IconShop is to exploit the sequential nature of SVG. Design a transformer-based architecture to achieve text-to-SVG.

## Pros and Cons

üü¢¬†Pros

- Could leverage foundation models to generate decent raster image (if we choose the solution of raster-to-svg)
- Have two state-of-the-art research solutions with different generative architectures for guidance
- Have sufficient dataset

üî¥¬†Cons

- No respective open-source Github repo available for checking the performance of the research paper
- Generation quality has the risk of not meeting the designer's requirements since there is limited research on SVG generation
